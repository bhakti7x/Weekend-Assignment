                    <p> Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist who resides just outside of Gotham City. As a child, Bruce
                    witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek 
                    vengeance against criminals. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune, 
                    which was amassed through investment in real estate before the city became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, 
                    his inherited conglomerate. Bruce Wayne resides just outside of Gotham City in Wayne Manor. He supports philanthropic causes through his 
                    nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. </p>
